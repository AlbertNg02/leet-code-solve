# Testcase Example:  '121'
#
# Given an integer x, return true if x is a palindrome, and false otherwise.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: x = 121
# Output: true
# Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: x = -121
# Output: false
# Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it
# becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
# 
# 
# Example 3:
# 
# 
# Input: x = 10
# Output: false
# Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a
# palindrome.
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# -2^31 <= x <= 2^31 - 1
# 
# 
# 
# Follow up: Could you solve it without converting the integer to a string?

class Solution:
    def isPalindrome(self, x: int) -> bool:
        if x<0: return False

        div = 1
        while x>=10 * div:
            div *= 10
        while x:
            right = x % 10
            left = x // div

            if left != right: return False

            x = (x % div ) //10
            div = div / 100
        return True
